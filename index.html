	<h2>Mundanities</h2>
	<p>I read <a href="https://www.philocomp.net">pedantry and pedantry</a> at the college most likely to <i>prima facie</i> (if somewhat unjustly) be seen as the closest analogue to Cowling’s Peterhouse in Oxford.</p>
	<p>I welcome correspondence—</p>
	<ul>
	<li>by post during Full Term: the name and college address will do;</li>
	<li>by electronic mail: append to my first and surname the college, followed by ‘ox.ac.uk’; and</li>
	<li>by electronic mail, avoiding the prying eyes of the university: prepend ‘j@’ to this address.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Where did everything go?</h2>
	<p>There used to be a blog (or compilation of letters) at this address. Its pun of a name was fairly bad when first contrived, and is now increasingly outdated. I shall place the letters somewhere else, when time permits.</p>

	<h2>Walks</h2>
	<p>I walk approximately termly (with a slightly worried eye on Hilary) from Oxford to the other major city under <a href="https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/19390405.thames-valley-police-wont-investigated-cow-incident/">the ægis of the most august Thames Valley Police</a>.</p>
	<p>Anyone desirous of joining me is welcome to at least give such an indication; the solitude is on occasion welcome, so I reserve the right to refuse such an application.</p>

	<h2>Miscellany</h2>
	<p>The <a href="https://nyctographa.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-plural-of-octopus.html">plural of octopus is octopi</a>.
	<p><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v03/n06/bernard-williams/how-shall-we-sing-the-lord-s-song">Bernard Williams on Maurice Cowling</a>: ‘ At the end of this volume, at any rate, it is clear that Cowling’s thoughts, when they extract themselves from the activities of merely quoting, commenting and sneering, are in a state of such abject confusion, and his relation to what he believes is so evasive, that some special infusion of intellectual and spiritual grace will be needed for him to do better than Norman, or to feel his own situation more clearly.’</p>
	<p>The ministry is approached as an <a href="https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/1472906359112970240"></a>Oxonocantabrigian essay crisis</a>.</p>
	<p>Why disappear dissidents when you can <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1667443">lose paperwork instead</a>?
