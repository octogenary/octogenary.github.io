	<h2>June 2024</h2>
	<h3>Singapore-on-Thames is further upstream than you think!</h3>
	<p>Banning all dishonesty on university or college premisses? It sounds like the sort of moral policing one would expect from the fever dream of Singapore’s <em>trente glorieuses</em>. Instead, one finds this (amongst several delights) in now-withdrawn proposals to amend Oxford’s Statutes, <a href="https://wellingtonsquarewatch.org/analysis">now Completely Illustrated in unedifying detail</a>.</p>

	<h3>Lentils for the garlic-addled</h3>
	<p>Pre-heat the oven to 150C or so. Soften garlic, shallots, onion, and chilli (or perhaps peppercorns) with thyme and parsley in a dutch oven. For each 200 grammes of lentils to be included, pour in a tin of tomatoes; for each 400 grammes, ½ litre of stock. Then pour in the lentils (puy or green work). Leave in the oven for about 50 minutes.</p>
	<p>I find this goes quite well with couscous and spinach: cook the couscous for ⅔ the cooking time recommended, quickly blanch the spinach, drain, then reheat the lentils until bubbling.</p>

	<h2>20 March 2024</h2>
	A recipe:
	<h3>Salmon</h3>
	Ingredients: olive oil and/or butter, anchovies, garlic, chilli, herbs to taste, salmon (I find 250 grammes per person sufficient), tomatoes—mix of large and cherry (I find 150 grammes total per person sufficient), stock (fish or vegetable, anywhere from 150 to 400 ml per person is fine, reduction time will vary).

	Put a dutch oven on medium heat on a stove, pre-heat the oven to about 160C fan, roughly cut the garlic and finely the chilli, and halve the cherry tomatoes, roughly chop the larger ones leaving some fairly large chunks.

	Soften the garlic, chilli, and anchovies in the oil and butter for five minutes. Then throw in the tomatoes and soften for ten.

	Pour in the stock and submerge the salmon for ten to twenty minutes. Whether to leave the lid on depends on how much stock you put in—I usually leave it on. Then left the salmon on top of the tomatoes so the skin is exposed and turn the oven to grill for another ten or twenty minutes, removing the salmon if it is too crisped.

	The salmon goes well with flatbread or pasta. In the case of pasta, a little less reduction is necessary, and the sauce can be tossed in some of the tomato sauce spooned out.

	One considerable advantage of this recipe is that the salmon overcooks very slowly, because it is immersed in the tomato. One can also make small incisions in the meat to encourage the sauce to fill it.

	<p>Rory Stewart <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/afghanistan-papers-craig-whitlock-book-review-rory-stewart/">in the <em>TLS</em></a> (<a href="https://archive.ph/OpqQa">archived</a>) on Afghanistan:
		<blockquote>
			<p>So when Rumsfeld says he has no idea what the US is doing, or what the mission is, or “who the bad guys are”, he does not mean, as Whitlock implies, that nobody has been producing plans or objectives or analysis. He means that he doesn’t like what he sees. The same is true when others later say that Rumsfeld himself did not have a plan. Or when various generals arrive claiming there is no plan, write a detailed plan, and then hand over to a successor who claims there is no plan, before writing a detailed plan and handing over to a successor feigning bafflement.</p>
			<p>But what if the interviewees and Craig Whitlock are telling you more about themselves than about Afghanistan? What if there was indeed deep corruption in Afghanistan, but that there were also highly intelligent and dedicated public servants, including President Ghani himself? What if there had never been a conscious conspiracy to conceal the problems of Afghanistan? What if the US could have kept 2,500 troops relatively safely and indefinitely in Afghanistan (as it keeps 25,000 troops, seventy years after the cessation of formal conflict, in South Korea)? What if the sunk costs of the intervention were immense, but the marginal costs of remaining were minimal? What if no magical plan could have existed for Afghanistan but, nevertheless, keeping a very few troops would have saved the country from a Taliban government, protected basic political and civil rights, supported women – at least in urban areas and much of the rural Centre and North – prevented the economy and the health and education systems from collapsing, and kept millions from the edge of starvation?</p>
			<p>What if the US withdrawal was determined not by the “Bloody Battle in Affghanistan” but by the “Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States”? What if Afghans were not cowards or incompetents but instead as smart and good as you and me?</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“There are lot of people who hold the view that the current flag looks like a sunflower. And because of that, our state has been unable to rise up since it could do nothing but gaze upon the sun,” [the President, Sadyr] Japarov told a journalist[.]</p>
		<p>Where the rays in the older design were soft and wavy, they are now straight and spiky.</p>
		<p>As the word began spreading that somebody might have composed a flag with the wrong number of rays — and the detail is important as the number of rays is meant to represent the 40 Kyrgyz tribes — officials scrambled to limit the damage.</p>
		<p>Sure enough, on the night of January 3, Bishkek municipal workers were filmed lowering the flag and counting the rays up to the requisite number.</p>
		<p>That has not convinced the doubters, who suspect the wrong flag was simply substituted for a corrected version under the cover of night to enable this piece of choreography.</p>
		<p>It appears that subsequent to lawmakers giving their blessing to a new flag, the government tinkered further, thereby defying parliament’s prerogative to make final decisions on such matters.</p>
		<p>This all means at least four — not to say almost certainly more — types of Kyrgyz flags in total exist out in the world: the original, parliament’s version, the government’s version, and, it appears, a defective 39-rayed variant of the government’s version.</p>
		<p>“The new flag should have been raised in the presence of a guard of honor. At least in the presence of the secretary of state. And the national anthem should have been played. (Only an enemy force sneaks in and swaps the flag),” he [Tazabek Ikramov, a lawmaker] wrote on Facebook.</p>
		<p>Japarov’s team has grown weary of all this. The head of the presidential administration, Kanybek Tumanbayev, has called for punishments for anybody spreading what he termed “fake information” about the number of rays on the flag.</p>
		<p>Tumanbayev is concerned, among other things, that continued discussions on this topic are going to embarrass Kyrgyzstan.</p>
		<p>“Not only does such false information create discontent among many people, but now our Kazakh neighbors are discussing it too,“ he moaned.</p>
		<p>Human rights activist Gulshayir Abdirasulova wrote on January 4 that the State Committee for National Security, or GKNB, the successor agency to the KGB, has been summoning people grumbling about the 39 rays matter for questioning.</p>

	<h4>Circular and miscellaneous walks thence and possibly thither</h4>
	<p>I have found the following to be feasible; in determining the applicability of that datum, it may be noted that I am not particularly athletic, although walking is not terribly strenuous since I am not particularly big.</p>
	<p>About four or five miles: from central Oxford to the towpath, turn away from Port Meadow towards University Parks, thence down Mesopotamia and through the verge of Cowley back to the High Street.</p>
	<p>A reasonable approximation of a half marathon proceeds from the High Street down St Aldate’s to the river, turns right and follows the river before following Castle Mill Stream and the canal path until Godstow; turn left to the Isis, and follow it until the path finally meets Wytham woods, before following the Green Belt Way in a loop back to the Thames path; follow that southwards opposite Port Meadow, and through Osney, before breaking off at St Aldate’s again, and returning to the city centre (perhaps the High Street). The path is not very well-maintained beyond Port Meadow.</p>
	<p>About nine miles: down the towpath to Port Meadow, following the foot of which one reaches the Thames Path—continue to Wolvercote, turn right through the urban fringe and along the A40 briefly before a rather obscure turn leads to the Cherwell, leading eventually to University Parks and a choice of Mesopotamia or a more direct route.</p>
	<p>About twenty-five miles: as above to the Thames Path, which should be followed until Farmoor Reservoir, whence Cumnor, I think Boars Hill and Kennington, and then back down the Thames to central Oxford. </p> 
	<p>About forty miles: down the Thames Path to Reading, with a stop at a pub for lunch; take the train back from the station.</p>

This rule is designed to ensure that unpopular people and causes can get legal representation. In philosophy, by contrast, we know we need no structural rule to ensure that seemingly hopeless causes receive representation from the brightest minds. And so we find Timothy Williamson, who famously defended epistemicism about vagueness over a quarter of a century ago, turning in his new book to another unpopular cause, the view that the meaning of ‘if’ is given by the material conditional.’</p>
