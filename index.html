	<h2>Mundanities</h2>
	<p>I read <a href="https://www.philocomp.net">pedantry and pedantry</a> at the college most likely to <i>prima facie</i> (if somewhat unjustly) be seen as the closest analogue to Cowling’s Peterhouse in Oxford.</p>
	<p>I welcome correspondence—</p>
	<ul>
	<li>by post during Full Term: the name and college address will do;</li>
	<li>by electronic mail: append to my first and surname the college, followed by ‘ox.ac.uk’; and</li>
	<li>by electronic mail, avoiding the prying eyes of the university: prepend ‘j@’ to this address.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Where did everything go?</h2>
	<p>There used to be a blog (or compilation of letters) at this address. Its pun of a name was fairly bad when first contrived, and is now increasingly outdated.</p>
	<p>I shall place the letters somewhere else, when time permits.</p>

	<h2>Oxford</h2>
	<h3>Matters universitary</h3>
	<p><a href="uploads/examination-results-school-type-oxford.xlsx"</a>Statistics</a> on results at first and second public examinations by school status.</p>
	<h3>Circular and miscellaneous walks thence and possibly thither</h3>
	<p>I have found the following to be feasible; in determining the applicability of that datum, it may be noted that I am not particularly athletic, although walking is not terribly strenuous since I am not particularly big.</p>
	<p>About four or five miles: from central Oxford to the towpath, turn away from Port Meadow towards University Parks, thence down Mesopotamia and through the verge of Cowley back to the High Street.</p>
	<p>A reasonable approximation of a half marathon proceeds from the High Street down St Aldate’s to the river, turns right and follows the river before following Castle Mill Stream and the canal path until Godstow; turn left to the Isis, and follow it until the path finally meets Wytham woods, before following the Green Belt Way in a loop back to the Thames path; follow that southwards opposite Port Meadow, and through Osney, before breaking off at St Aldate’s again, and returning to the city centre (perhaps the High Street). The path is not very well-maintained beyond Port Meadow.</p>
	<p>About nine miles: down the towpath to Port Meadow, following the foot of which one reaches the Thames Path—continue to Wolvercote, turn right through the urban fringe and along the A40 briefly before a rather obscure turn leads to the Cherwell, leading eventually to University Parks and a choice of Mesopotamia or a more direct route.</p>
	<p>About twenty-five miles: as above to the Thames Path, which should be followed until Farmoor Reservoir, whence Cumnor, I think Boars Hill and Kennington, and then back down the Thames to central Oxford. </p> 
	<p>About forty miles: down the Thames Path to Reading, with a stop at a pub for lunch; take the train back from the station.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v03/n06/bernard-williams/how-shall-we-sing-the-lord-s-song">Bernard Williams on Maurice Cowling</a>: ‘ At the end of this volume, at any rate, it is clear that Cowling’s thoughts, when they extract themselves from the activities of merely quoting, commenting and sneering, are in a state of such abject confusion, and his relation to what he believes is so evasive, that some special infusion of intellectual and spiritual grace will be needed for him to do better than Norman, or to feel his own situation more clearly.’</p>

The police agreed to this[.]’</p>
	<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/mind/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mind/fzab049/6414892?login=true">Daniel Rothschild in <i>Mind</i></a>: ‘Barristers in England are obliged to follow the ‘cab rank rule’, according to which they must take any case offered to them, as long as they have time in their schedule and can agree on fees. This rule is designed to ensure that unpopular people and causes can get legal representation. In philosophy, by contrast, we know we need no structural rule to ensure that seemingly hopeless causes receive representation from the brightest minds. And so we find Timothy Williamson, who famously defended epistemicism about vagueness over a quarter of a century ago, turning in his new book to another unpopular cause, the view that the meaning of ‘if’ is given by the material conditional.’</p>
